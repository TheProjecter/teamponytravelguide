The travel guide application that we plan to implement using J2ME will consist of a variety of usefull features that will aid a tourist in major cities throughout Europe.  The main features of this travel guide will be a Landmark Finder, Phrase Book, Currency Converter, Survival Guide, a Map. To begin with the travel guide will cover 2 major cities in Europe. These cities will be Dublin and Paris. In later development of the project we hope to try to add extra cities to the Application.
